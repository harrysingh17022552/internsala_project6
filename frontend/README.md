# PRoject Requirement

To Check the functionality and logics required, please visit attached pdf.
From that requirement, I had modified the one functionality of browseBook Component that is dynamically listing the categorized book, because that functionality I have given at home page to visit dynamically category page, and on browseBook page I have given functionality to filter as per category statically. That looks more better according to me.

# Note

1. Hey, You can revert last 1 commit, because I have added some extra things to work app better.
2. Please ignore the error in console of image fetching, the image url might be broken.
3. Few Animation are used on main Component like Home, Browse Books & Add Books.
